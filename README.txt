ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ | I am a full stack web developer with a profile oriented towards the frontend and with basic knowledge in UX/UI Design. I consider myself very creative and #persevering, with a great willingness to learn and carry out new tasks and projects. Totally entrenched in teamwork and agile SCRUM methodologies.

I have a solid background in technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and Sequelize. I also like design and editing programs like Figma, Sony Vegas and Photoshop.
I am developing new projects for my portfolio, learning Material UI in an advanced way and taking my first steps in the Java language in search of my complementary knowledge.
