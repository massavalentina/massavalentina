    <h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Valentina</h1>
    <h3 align="center"> I am a full stack web developer with a profile oriented towards the front end and with basic knowledge in UX/UI Design. I consider myself as very creative and persevering person, with a great willingness to learn and carry out new tasks and projects. Totally entrenched with teamwork and agile SCRUM methodologies.

I have a solid knowledge in technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and Sequelize. 

I'm currently developing new projects for my portfolio, learning Material UI in an advanced way and taking my first steps in the Java language in search of my complementary knowledge.
Also, I'm studying at the university and doing sports activities to give my mind a break.</h3>
